# MonitoringGrid.Core Deep Cleanup Round 3 Summary

## Overview
Completed the third comprehensive deep cleanup round of the MonitoringGrid.Core project, implementing advanced Domain-Driven Design patterns including Specification Pattern, Domain Events, Aggregate Roots, Factory Patterns, and enhanced Repository patterns.

## Phase 1: Specification Pattern Implementation ✅

### Problem
- Complex business queries scattered throughout the codebase
- No reusable query logic for common business scenarios
- Difficult to test and maintain query logic

### Solution
Implemented the Specification Pattern for encapsulating business rules:

**Created Specification Infrastructure:**
- `ISpecification<T>` - Base specification interface with criteria, includes, ordering, and pagination
- `BaseSpecification<T>` - Abstract base implementation with fluent API methods
- Support for complex queries with navigation properties and ordering

**Created KPI Specifications (9 specifications):**
- `KpisDueForExecutionSpecification` - KPIs ready for execution
- `KpisByOwnerSpecification` - KPIs filtered by owner
- `HighPriorityKpisSpecification` - High priority KPIs (SMS alerts)
- `StaleKpisSpecification` - KPIs that haven't run recently
- `FrequentAlertKpisSpecification` - KPIs with frequent alerts
- `KpisByFrequencyRangeSpecification` - KPIs by frequency range
- `KpisByDeviationThresholdSpecification` - KPIs by deviation threshold
- `KpisInCooldownSpecification` - KPIs in cooldown period
- `KpiSearchSpecification` - Search KPIs by indicator name

**Created Alert Specifications (8 specifications):**
- `UnresolvedAlertsSpecification` - Unresolved alerts
- `AlertsBySeveritySpecification` - Alerts by severity level
- `AlertsByDateRangeSpecification` - Alerts within date range

- `DomainEvent` - Abstract base record implementation
- `IDomainEventHandler<T>` - Interface for event handlers
- `IDomainEventPublisher` - Interface for publishing events

**Created KPI Events (5 events):**
- `KpiExecutedEvent` - Raised when KPI is executed
- `KpiCreatedEvent` - Raised when KPI is created
- `KpiUpdatedEvent` - Raised when KPI configuration is updated
- `KpiDeactivatedEvent` - Raised when KPI is deactivated
- `KpiThresholdBreachedEvent` - Raised when KPI threshold is breached

**Created Alert Events (5 events):**
- `AlertTriggeredEvent` - Raised when alert is triggered
- `AlertResolvedEvent` - Raised when alert is resolved

- Domain event collection and management methods

**Enhanced KPI Entity as Aggregate Root:**
- Inherits from `AggregateRoot`
- Added domain event raising methods:
  - `MarkAsExecuted()` - Raises execution and threshold breach events
  - `Deactivate()` - Raises deactivation event with business rule validation
  - `UpdateConfiguration()` - Raises update event
  - `ValidateConfiguration()` - Comprehensive validation with custom exceptions

**Created Factory Patterns:**
- `IKpiFactory` and `KpiFactory` - Factory for creating KPI entities with validation
  - `CreateKpi()` - Creates KPI with full validation
  - `CreateFromTemplate()` - Creates KPI from template
  - `CreateCopy()` - Creates copy of existing KPI
- `IAlertFactory` and `AlertFactory` - Factory for creating Alert entities
  - `CreateAlert()` - Creates alert from KPI execution results
  - `CreateTestAlert()` - Creates test alert for validation
  - `CreateThresholdAlert()` - Creates alert from threshold breach

**Benefits:**
- Proper aggregate boundaries and consistency
- Centralized entity creation with validation
- Domain events automatically raised for business operations
- Better encapsulation of business rules

## Phase 4: Repository Improvements ✅

### Problem
- Generic repository lacked specification support
- No Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- Missing domain event integration in data access

### Solution
Enhanced repository pattern with specifications and Unit of Work:

**Enhanced IRepository<T> Interface:**
- Added specification-based query methods:
  - `GetAsync(ISpecification<T>)` - Get entities using specification
  - `GetPagedAsync(ISpecification<T>)` - Paginated queries with specifications
  - `GetFirstOrDefaultAsync(ISpecification<T>)` - First entity matching specification
  - `CountAsync(ISpecification<T>)` - Count entities matching specification
  - `AnyAsync(ISpecification<T>)` - Check existence using specification

**Created Unit of Work Pattern:**
- `IUnitOfWork` - Interface for managing transactions and domain events
  - Repository access through generic `Repository<T>()` method
  - Transaction management with Begin/Commit/Rollback
  - Domain event management with Add/Get/Clear methods
  - Automatic domain event publishing on save

**Benefits:**
- Specification pattern integration in data access
- Proper transaction management
- Domain events automatically published with data changes
- Better separation of concerns in data access

## Phase 5: Domain Exceptions ✅

### Problem
- Generic exceptions without domain context
- No business rule violation tracking
- Missing specific exception types for domain operations

### Solution
Created comprehensive domain exception hierarchy:

**Created Domain Exception Types:**
- `DomainException` - Base class for all domain exceptions
- `BusinessRuleViolationException` - Business rule violations with rule details
