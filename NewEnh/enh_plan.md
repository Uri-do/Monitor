1. Added new row in PopAI.monitoring.Config with key 'ProgressPlayDbConnectionString' and value 'Data Source=192.168.166.11,1433;Initial Catalog=ProgressPlayDB;User ID=saturn;Password=xxxxx;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly' with the real password, i marked it as encrypted, please encrypt it. and then make sure it is being used instead of the ProgressPlayDBTest connection string from the settings files.
2. see files monitor_statistics__collectors_sample.csv which are the collectors that ProgressPlayDB already run (no need for this system to manage this) and insert stats every hour, by hour, into stats.tbl_Monitor_Statistics. 
3. see C:\Dev\code\Monitor\NewEnh\progressplaydb_stats_monitor_sps.txt for the stored procedures that are already created in ProgressPlayDB, no need to change them. but they need to be used when running Indicator
Added a new table in PopAI monitoring.Indicators and added first 3 indicators from the file C:\Dev\code\Monitor\NewEnh\popai_indicators.csv as samples.
I want to replace the existing KPI functionality with the new indicator functionality. when creating a new Indicator the user should choose a Collector from ProgressPlayDB.stats.tbl_Monitor_StatisticsCollectors, and after that one of the ItemName available in ProgressPlayDB.stats.tbl_Monitor_Statistics for this collector. 
and then we will continue. plan and ask if something is not clear
