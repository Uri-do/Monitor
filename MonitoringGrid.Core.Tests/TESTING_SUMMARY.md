## Test Architecture Quality

### 🏗️ **Test Structure**
- **Organized by Pattern:** Tests grouped by DDD patterns (ValueObjects, Specifications, Factories, Entities)
- **Clear Naming:** Descriptive test method names following Given_When_Then pattern
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All public methods and business rules tested
- **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions and error scenarios covered

### 🧪 **Test Quality**
- **Isolation:** Each test is independent and can run in any order
- **Fast Execution:** All tests complete in under 1 second
- **Deterministic:** Tests produce consistent results across runs
- **Readable:** Clear arrange-act-assert structure

### 📊 **Testing Patterns Used**
- **Theory Tests:** Parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios
- **Fact Tests:** Single scenario validation tests
- **Exception Testing:** Proper error handling validation
- **Fluent Assertions:** Readable and expressive test assertions

## Business Logic Validation

### ✅ **Domain Rules Tested**
1. **KPI Validation Rules:**
   - Priority must be 1 (SMS + Email) or 2 (Email Only)
   - Frequency must be positive
   - Deviation must be between 0-100%
   - Required fields cannot be empty

2. **Specification Business Logic:**
   - KPIs due for execution based on frequency and last run
   - Priority-based filtering for alert routing
   - Stale KPI detection for monitoring health
   - Search functionality across multiple fields

3. **Value Object Constraints:**
   - Email address format validation
   - Deviation percentage bounds and calculations
   - Severity level determination based on thresholds

4. **Aggregate Root Behavior:**
   - Domain event raising for business operations
   - Business rule enforcement (e.g., cannot deactivate inactive KPI)
   - State consistency maintenance

## Test Infrastructure

### 🔧 **Testing Framework**
- **xUnit:** Primary testing framework
- **FluentAssertions:** Expressive assertion library
- **Moq:** Mocking framework (available for future integration tests)
- **AutoFixture:** Test data generation (available for complex scenarios)
- **Bogus:** Fake data generation (available for realistic test data)
