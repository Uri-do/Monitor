## Routes Added

### Public Routes
- `/login` - User login page
- `/register` - User registration page

### Protected Routes
- `/profile` - User profile page
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (requires System:Admin)
- `/admin/users` - User management (requires User:Read)
- `/admin/roles` - Role management (requires Role:Read)
- `/admin/settings` - System settings (requires System:Admin)

## Permission System

### Permission Structure
```typescript
interface Permission {
  permissionId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  resource: string;
  action: string;
}
```

### Permission Examples
- `User:Read` - View users
- `User:Write` - Create/update users
- `User:Delete` - Delete users
- `Role:Read` - View roles
- `Role:Write` - Create/update roles
- `System:Admin` - Full system administration

## Data Models

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  userId: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  department?: string;
  title?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  emailConfirmed: boolean;
  roles: Role[];
  permissions: string[];
  createdDate: string;
  lastLogin?: string;
}
```

### Role Model
```typescript
interface Role {
  roleId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  isSystemRole: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdDate: string;
}
```

## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT token storage in localStorage
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure logout with token cleanup

### Authorization
- Permission-based access control
- Route-level protection
- Component-level permission checks

### Password Security
- Strong password requirements
- Password change functionality
- Account lockout protection

## UI/UX Features

### Design System
- Material-UI components
- Consistent styling and theming
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### User Experience
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Loading states and error handling
- Intuitive navigation and breadcrumbs

### Data Management
- Real-time data updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error recovery and retry logic

## Integration Points

### Backend API
- RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- Standardized request/response formats
- Error handling and validation

### State Management
- React Context for global state
- React Query for server state
- Local state for component-specific data

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Service function tests
- Utility function tests

### Integration Tests
- User flow testing
- API integration testing
- Permission system testing

### E2E Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Conclusion

The user management system provides a comprehensive foundation for managing users, roles, and permissions in the MonitoringGrid application. The implementation follows modern React patterns, includes robust error handling, and provides an intuitive user experience.

The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, with clear separation of concerns and modular architecture. Future enhancements can be easily integrated into the existing structure.
